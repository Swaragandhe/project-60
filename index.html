    <p> Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a surface. The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used. In art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the actionMy hobby is to paint. I love to paint with acrylics. Paintings makes me happy. Painting sharpens the mind through conceptual visualization and implementation, plus, boosts memory skills. A painting is something which expresses your emotions,feeling etc.</p>
